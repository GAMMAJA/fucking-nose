  <p>You think I can't handle dancing on my own
  It takes two to tango but only one to let go
  I'm sorry I can't answer, I'm busy dancing on my own
  <strong>It takes two to <u>tango</u> but only one to let go</strong></p>
  <p>I let you say your piece
  And toss your keys so you can leave
  I'm laying under comfy sheets
  Not playing these games
  I been looking to all the prophets
  Praying for some different problems
  I know that it's not that deep but all I can say is</p>
  <p>I'm doing fine, thought you should know
  Stretching my legs without you home
  I'm doing fine, thought you should know
  I'm alright</p>
  <p>You think I can't handle dancing on my own
  It takes two to tango but only one to let go
  I'm sorry I can't answer, I'm busy dancing on my own

  <p style="margin-top:70px;">I curse you out, you piss me off
  Blew a kiss, I flipped you off
  And no, I won't pick up your calls, I'm busy today
  Damn, this shit just got so toxic
  Don't think I don't got no options
  I know that it's not that deep but all I can say is</p>

  <p>Running low on fuel
  Running low on juice
  I've been taking L's from left to right to middle
  How'd this shit just get so toxic?
  Running low on fuel
  Running low on juice
